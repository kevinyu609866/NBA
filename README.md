# NBA

I've always been interested in sports analytics! My first ever project in predictive modeling was in 2018- where I predicted the amount of wins a NBA team would achieve based on their regular season results.
This project is a tweak of a project I did in the mist of the pandemic, where I used historical data to correctly predict that the Miami Heat would make it to the Finals.

Similarly, this time around the model correctly predicted at the Milwaukee Bucks would be within the top 2 teams! They ended up not just being top 2, but winning it all!

This project aims to find the correlation between regular season statistics and post-season success. 
The training data was scraped from https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/ 
The y-labels were distributed as a metric of how many games were on, with -1's indiciating not making playoffs entirely.

The model correctly predicted 13/16 teams that made the 2020-2021 playoffs, with the 2 of the 3 teams that were incorrectly predicted being play-in teams. 
The model also correctly predicted the top performing teams in the playoffs, including predicting the eventual victor (Milwaukee Bucks) to be within the top 2 teams.
